                Our Story
              </h2>
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-secondary-600 mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Camp Gan Israel is the premier Jewish day camp in the North Fulton area. Now in our 27th season, 
                our camp attracts hundreds of campers from all backgrounds and affiliations.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-secondary-600 mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Since the completion of our new campus in 2019, virtually all our outdoor space was used up by 
                the new building and parking lot, leaving the camp children without proper areas for sports and play. 
                Fortunately, a few years ago we were able to purchase the property next door, and we are now launching 
                an exciting project to develop that land into much-needed outdoor facilities.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-secondary-600 leading-relaxed">
                Our new sports complex will include a <strong>Baseball field, Soccer field, Basketball court, Pickleball court, 
                and an amazing new playground</strong>â€”that will allow our campers to play, grow, and thrive in a safe and active environment.
